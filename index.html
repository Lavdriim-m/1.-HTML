    <p><strong>Tiramisu</strong> is a timeless no-bake Italian dessert combining
    espresso-dipped ladyfingers and a creamy lightly sweetened mascarpone
    cream. <br/> This recipe is from the late Maide Heatter and is easily
    the best homemade tiramisu recipe that I've tried.</p>

    <p>A couple months ago, I was sent a new cookbook called Happiness
        is Baking. This cookbook includes Maida Heatter's favorite recipes
        with the foreword written by Dorie Greenspan. I, unsurprisingly,
        immediately fell in love with my newest cookbook. It's a collection
        of 100 foolproof and classic desserts including cookies, cakes,
        muffins, pies, tarts, and more that range from simple everyday
        cookies to outrageously indulgent chocolate souffle cake.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cups (300ml) very strongly prepared espresso, warm or room temperature</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons (90ml) Grand Marnier*</li>
        <li>40-45 ladyfingers*</li>
        <li>16 ounces (about 2 cups; 450 g) mascarpone, cold or at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) dark rum</li>
        <li>4 large pasteurized eggs, separated*</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar, divided*</li>
        <li>2 cups (480ml) heavy cream or heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For those not familiar, Maida Heatter is an icon, especially in the baking world.
        Dubbed the Queen of Cake, her expensive culinary career included 9 cookbooks, recipes
        for the Times, a restaurant, and three James Beard Awards. Baker and author Dorie
        Greenspan once said "Whenever someone tells me they want to learn to bake, I tell them to
        start with Maida Heatter's books. That's what I did." This latest cookbook is a testament to
        Maida's legacy. She passed away only 2 months after this book was published. She leaves
        an incalculable amount of inspiration to bakers and cooks all over the world.

    <h3>Common Tiramisu Questions - Answered</h3>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>What kind of rum do I use in tiramisu?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Dark rum is best, but you can use brandy or your favorite coffee liqueur.</dd>
        
        <br/>

        <dt><strong>Egg whites or whipped cream?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Most tiramisu recipes use whipped egg whites OR whipped cream in the mascarpone cream layers.
            Egg whites contribute a more airy texture, while whipped cream makes the filling a bit
            more rich. This recipe actually uses both, so you're getting both delightful textures.
        </dd>

        <br/>

        <dt><strong>Are the eggs cooked?</strong></dt>
        <dd>Tiramisu is a no-bake dessert. The egg yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop,
            but the egg whites are raw. Purchase pasteurized eggs because they are safe to
            consume raw.
        </dd>

        <br/>

        <dt><strong>What size pan to use?</strong></dt>
        <dd>This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full.
            Make sure your pan is large enough. I recommend a 9x13 inch dish with at least a 12-14
            cup capacity. This 4 quart dish is wonderful too.
